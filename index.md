I am currently a Ph.D student at the [Agumented Human Communication Laboratory, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)](http://ahclab.naist.jp/index_en.html).

My research interests are related to speech technologies such as speech recognition, speech translation,
paralinguistic extraction and translation as well. You can find more details on [publication page](http://www.truongdq.com/publication).
